The description of the fractured mirror is &quot;<span class="quote">A mirror with jagged, broken edges. It seems to reflect not just your image but fragments of memories and emotions.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of examining the fractured mirror:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The mirror shows splintered reflections, some of which seem to move independently of you. As you focus, one of the shards sharpens, revealing a memory not your own. It whispers, 'Piece together what was lost.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A swirling sigil is in Beyond the Light. The swirling sigil is fixed in place. The description of the swirling sigil is &quot;<span class="quote">A glowing, shifting sigil etched into the air. Its shape never settles, and its patterns seem to pull at the edges of your mind.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of touching the swirling sigil:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">As your hand approaches the sigil, a pulse of energy pushes you back. It hums faintly, as though requiring something specific to activate.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A memory fragment is a kind of thing. Three memory fragments are in Beyond the Light.

The description of the silver shard is &quot;<span class="quote">A small fragment of light, shimmering faintly. It hums with an energy that feels familiar yet distant.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The crimson shard is a memory fragment in Beyond the Light. The description of the crimson shard is &quot;<span class="quote">A shard pulsing with a deep red glow. It feels warm to the touch, as though it holds a fragment of something powerful.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The azure shard is a memory fragment in Beyond the Light. The description of the azure shard is &quot;<span class="quote">A shard of deep blue, cool and soothing. It resonates with a quiet strength.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of inserting a memory fragment into the swirling sigil:</p><p class="indent1">if the player encloses the silver shard and the player encloses the crimson shard and the player encloses the azure shard:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">As you place the final shard into the sigil, it flares brightly, and the fractured mirror begins to glow. The pieces rearrange themselves, forming a coherent image that reveals a path forward. A low voice echoes in your mind, 'The fragments of your being align. Step forward with purpose.'</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">now the fractured mirror is open;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">The sigil pulses faintly but remains inert. More pieces are required.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The fractured mirror is a door. The fractured mirror is closed. The fractured mirror is east of Beyond the Light and west of the Final Threshold.</p><p class="indent0">The Final Threshold is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">The air here is heavy with meaning, and the space seems to fold in on itself. Shapes and patterns stretch infinitely, and yet they feel confined within your grasp. You sense you are nearing the end of this strange journey, but the final truth remains just out of reach.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A figure of resolve is a person in the Final Threshold. The description of the figure of resolve is &quot;<span class="quote">The figure stands tall, neither male nor female, cloaked in shifting light and shadow. Its presence exudes a quiet strength, as though it has been waiting for you.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After examining the figure of resolve:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The figures gaze pierces through you, though its features are ever-changing. It speaks in a voice that resonates within your very being: 'You have come far, piecing together the fragments of your existence. Now, one final choice remains.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After asking the figure of resolve about something:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The figures voice surrounds you. 'This is the end of the journey, but also the beginning. You must step forward and embrace the truth of who you are.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going east in the Final Threshold:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">With the figures words still echoing in your mind, you step forward. The light and darkness collapse into a single point, and you are filled with a sense of completion.
